      <p>Lucius Annaeus Seneca, the Younger. "Letters from a Stoic".</p>
      <blockquote><p>If you see a person not frightened by dangers, untouched by desires, cheerful in
        difficult circumstances, calm amidst the storms, looking at human beings from a
        higher place and upon the gods from their own level—will you not be in awe of
        such a man? Will you not say, ‘This is a thing so great and lofty that one cannot
        believe it is similar to the paltry body it inhabits?’</p></blockquote>
      <p>Roosevelt, Theodore. "Citizenship in a Republic".</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, 
          or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is 
          actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; 
          who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; 
          but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; 
          who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,
           and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never 
           be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</p>
