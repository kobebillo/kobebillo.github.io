      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a network engineer passionate about Service Provider and Enterprise Solution Design. My favorite work lies at the intersection of design and development, implementing routing protocols that are not only optimized for performance but also built for scalability and reliability.</p>
      <p>I earned a scholarship based on my academic performance and received a BA in Information Technology from MAPÚA University, graduating cum laude. Outside my formal education, I passed CCNP Service Provider on August 16, 2024 and I am currently self-studying for the CCIE Service Provider, typically dedicating my after-work hours and rest days to it. My role at Comcast Masergy, where I work with Nokia SR7750 and Fortinet SD-WAN, prepares me for the Service Provider track by gaining hands-on experience in managing and maintaining the Masergy backbone.</p>
      <p>In my spare time, I'm usually at the boxing gym training and watching local fights, hanging out with my nephew, watching movies and animes at home, or finally updating my documentations on Github.</p>

      <h1>Work Experience</h1>
      <h3>Comcast Masergy<p class="view"><small>May 2024 - Current</small></p></h3>
      <p>As a NOC Analyst at Comcast Masergy, I provide technical solutions to support and transform customer networks. With hands-on experience in SD-WAN, Internet routing, and secure connectivity. I have been responsible for setting up IPSec VPN Tunneling such as Site-to-Site and Remote Access VPN between our customers' organizations. I have experienced configuring and migrating our POPs for our customers' VPRN, VPLS, and IES services using Nokia SR7750. My role also involves troubleshooting and resolving escalated issues, where I collaborate with customers and service providers to quickly resolve network challenges.</p>
      <p>I am able to work under pressure and in fast-paced environments. I provide excellent communication and collaboration skills, which enable me to work effectively with customers and escalations. My focus is on ensuring smooth network operations, troubleshooting issues quickly, and maintaining optimal performance. I also contribute to on-call rotations, providing continuous support to meet the needs of our customers.</p>

      <p>Lucius Annaeus Seneca, the Younger. "Letters from a Stoic".</p>
      <blockquote><p>If you see a person not frightened by dangers, untouched by desires, cheerful in
        difficult circumstances, calm amidst the storms, looking at human beings from a
        higher place and upon the gods from their own level—will you not be in awe of
        such a man? Will you not say, ‘This is a thing so great and lofty that one cannot
        believe it is similar to the paltry body it inhabits?’</p></blockquote>
      <p>Roosevelt, Theodore. "Citizenship in a Republic".</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, 
          or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is 
          actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; 
          who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; 
          but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; 
          who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,
           and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never 
           be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</p>
